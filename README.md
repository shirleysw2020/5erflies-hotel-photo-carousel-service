# Project Name

> Project description:


On a generic airbnb listing page, using MongoDB hosted database for storing relevant data that will be displayed on the photo carousel service component.
I will set up APIs for client side to interact with the database. Next goal is the build the user interface with React and style components.

End goal is a seamless interaction between the client, api, and database to support optimized functionality and reach airbnb's business goal.
